# Smoothing-Methods-Prediction
Building a house price prediction model using smoothing methods

# Introduction  

The model produces a smoothing model that predict property prices based on a set 
of training data. First, we prepare the data by filling NA values by simple imputation 
methods. Then, we analyze the variables histogram and scatterplot to determine whether 
they need transformation. Lastly, we build the smoothing model. 
 
The prediction error will be evaluted using RMLSE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error). 

# Data  

Data set can be found in the Data file, which is available in 2 formats - RData and CSV
